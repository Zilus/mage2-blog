Simple Magento 2 Blog module

This module is based on the work of Ash Smith. @ https://www.ashsmith.io but improved by me :P

I tweak it to add some features missing.
- wysiwyg editor
- Dynamic SEO Keywords and description on post view (single post)
- Static XML Keywords and Description on blog index
- Admin area, with fields for keywords and description.
- Static Breadcrumbs on blog index
- Dynamic breadcrumbs on single post view.

ToDo:
- Admin configuration area for breadcrumbs and blog index SEO.
- Composer install
- Composer uninstall
